## Formula 1 Data Analysis

As a Formula 1 fan myself, I wanted to do an analysis on the F1 data and this
project is about the Exploratory Data Analysis on Formula 1 data from the year 1960-2020

## Roadmap

- Retrieving the data
- Data Preprocessing
- EDA and Data Visualization
- Getting the statistics of each driver

## Summary

* Statistics of each driver, like
    - nationality
    - Number of races
    - points
    - Number of Laps
    - Podium
    - Number of wins, poles and titles
* A graph that shows the number of races that happened every season from the year 1950
* A scatter plot that shows the countries that have hosted F1 race from the year 1950
* Ferari has the most number of F1 wins followed by McLaren and Williams
